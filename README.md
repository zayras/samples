# TESTING SAMPLE PROJECTS

## SQUARE
The Hello World of Three.js.  Just shows a rotating cube 


## POINT
Was supposed to show particles floating around, but it doesn't work yet so the button has been disabled.


## TRIANGLE
It shows a triangle that you can interact with. Drag, zoom-in, zoom-out and rotating it works.

## SPHERE
It is supposed to show state transitions but does not seem to work on github pages for some reason.

## TY
It is supposed to load a model using Three.js but some components do not work on Vue so it doesn't show anything so far.
So the button has been disabled for now.

## MODEL
Supposed to show a model of a phone which you can interact with. But this also does not work with github pages (Err: resource not found) so will have to fix it.

## SCROLL
Testing a progress bar where at the top of the page you can see the progress when you scroll down or up.
